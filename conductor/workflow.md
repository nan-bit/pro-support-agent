# Project Workflow

## Development Standards
- **Test Coverage:** Maintain at least 80% code test coverage for all new features and bug fixes.
- **Task Management:** Work is organized into tracks, each with a detailed plan.
- **Commit Frequency:** Commit changes to the repository after the successful completion of every task.
- **Task Summaries:** Use Git Notes to record a summary of the work performed for each task.

## Phase Completion Verification
For each phase in a track's plan, a manual verification task is required to ensure all phase goals have been met before proceeding.
